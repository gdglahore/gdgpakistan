## Local Development

This is a [Next.js][nextjs] application and uses [Tailwind][tailwind] for styling. For local development, you need
[Node.js][nodejs] installed. We recommend using [`asdf`][asdf] version manager for this.

After you have installed `asdf`, run the following to install the correct version of Node:

```bash
asdf install
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the local server for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To export the static site for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```
